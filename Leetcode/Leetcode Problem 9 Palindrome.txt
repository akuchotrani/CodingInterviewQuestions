9. Palindrome Number
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?	



Hint: Reverse thed digits by getting the unit digit and adding to the previous by multiplying 10
Language: C#

public class Solution {
    public bool IsPalindrome(int x) 
    {
        if(x < 0)
            return false;
        int input = x;
        int reversed = 0;
        
        while(x!=0)
        {
            int unitDigit = x%10;
            reversed = reversed*10 + unitDigit;
            x = x/10;
        }
        
        if(reversed == input)
        {
            return true;
        }
        else
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
