You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104




Hint:

Try to do it in single pass
Keep track of maxProfix so far
If min price found update the lowestPrice that stock can be purchased.



class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        lowestPrice = prices[0]
        maxProfit = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            diff = prices[i] - lowestPrice
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, diff)
            lowestPrice = min(lowestPrice, prices[i])
        
        return maxProfit
