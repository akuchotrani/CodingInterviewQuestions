279. Perfect Squares
Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.

Example 1:

Input: n = 12
Output: 3 
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
Example 2:

Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.


Hint to solve: 

class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        dpArray = [i for i in range(n)]
        #print(dpArray)
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                if j*j > i:
                    break
                #Here there's +1 since if we consider number of square from the previous cell we haven't considered the current cell
                dpArray[i] = min(dpArray[i], dpArray[i - j*j] + 1)
                        
        return dpArray[n-1]
