58. Length of Last Word


Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.



Hint: iterate through last element record start and end position.
Think about end cases where there is space character at the end
Single character
Single character with space

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        start = -1
        end = 0

        if len(s) == 1 and s[0] != ' ':
            return 1

        for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):
            #print(f"i: {i}")
            if start == -1 and s[i] == ' ':
                print("continue")
                continue
            #print(f"value of i : {i}")
            if start == -1:
                start = i
                #print(f"start: {start}")
            if s[i] == ' ':
                end = i+1
                #print(f"end: {end}")
                break
        return start - end + 1




Alternate easy solution with O(N) space complexity


Time complexity:
1. Stripping trailing whitespaces takes linear time, so it's O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
2. Splitting the string into words also takes linear time, so it's also O(n).
3. The overall time complexity is O(n).
Space complexity:
We store the list of words, which could take up to O(n) space if all characters in the input string are non-whitespace.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        words = s.strip().split()
        
        if not words:
            return 0
        
        return len(words[-1])
